  <span> Our Problem and Solution  
        <br> The Human Body knows a lot of diseases which may or may not be known to the general public. 
        <br> Many common diseases are still relatively unknown which comes with some disadvantages. 
        <br> For example: an idividual might not know of a certain disease and find out to late he/she is ill. 
        <br> To better inform people about the most common diseases we have designed this interactive tool.
        </span>
	<br> <br>
  <span>This tool may help someone to learn of a particular disease through the information provided
        <br> when hovering over a specific bodypart that the individual might feel to be affacted. He or she 
        <br> can then go to the external links provided to get further information about the disease in question.

  <span class="boxUnitTitle">&ensp; Our Question &ensp;</span>
  <hr style="width:43%">
  
  <br> <br>
  <span>As noted in the before, there are many diseases unknown to the general public.  
        <br>
  <span>We seek to inform people by obtaining data about the most common diseases that occur for some organs.
        <br> Unfortunately, there is no statistic on how often a certain disease occurs. We circumvent this 
        <br> lack of data by opting for the amount of entries per langue for a disease. More language entries
	<br> would usually mean that the disease is more widespead and thus more common. </span>
  <br> <br>
  <span>You can find out more about how we acquire such information on our <a href="Databases.html">databases</a> page, and you can test out this tool for a  
        <br> variety of disease clusters on our main <a href="Homepage.html">homepage</a>. </span>
